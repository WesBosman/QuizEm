Contributors: Wes Bosman, Brian Richardson, Charles Nimo, Thomas Oakley, Ferdinand Agyei-Yeboah.
Requires at least: Android 4.0.1
Tested up to: Android API Version 22

Usage
The app opens up to a screen where the user can choose between flashcards (not yet implemented) or quizzes. The user can navigate through the path they choose to make, take, and view their respective quizzes or flashcards.

Progress:
The following user stories were implemented this iteration:
-Make A Quiz
-Save A Quiz (i.e into database)
-Delete A Question
-View All Saved Quizzes 

Future Implementation
The “Flash” and “Take a quiz” buttons on the home screen are for layout purposes and not functional as of yet. The functionality of these buttons will be developed in the next iteration.

Miscellaneous
Background images and layouts for the app were created in Photoshop. These have not been implemented yet in the app. However, they have been pushed to GitHub and marked off as a mileston. In the next iteration we plan to add more functionality to the app as well as replace the plain layout of the app with the backgrounds.
